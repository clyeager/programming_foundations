# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

#Casual

-Define a method named add that takes two integers
-Add the two integers together
-Add two integer variables
-End method
-Greet user
-Ask user for two integers, store each into a variable, num_one, num_two, while converting those to integers
-Call the add method on the two variables and store that into a result variable
-Print out the result for the user

#Formal

START

#Given two integers, called number_one and number_two
SET a method named add that takes two arguments, defined by parameters called number_one and number_two
Add number_one converted to an integer + number_two converted to an integer
End method here so the result of the addition will be implicitly returned

GET number_one from user and save into number_one variable
GET number_two from user and save into number_two variable

SET result variable = Calling add method on number_one, number_two variables
PRINT result to user

END of program

#2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings
concatenated together

#Casual

-Define a method named concat that takes an array of strings called array
-Call the join method on array while passing it a - delimiter to concatenate with a - between
each word
-End method

-Print the result of calling the concat method on an array of strings

#Formal

START

#Given an array of strings called array
SET a method named concat that takes an array parameter called array
Call join('-') on array
End method

SET input_array = []
Ask the user what group of words they would like to join together
SET input = user input
Push the input into input_array array
SET result = calling concat method on input_array
PRINT result of that call
